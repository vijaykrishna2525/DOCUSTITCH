This part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) outlines the requirements for preventing, detecting, and responding to sexual abuse in Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration detention facilities, including data collection, incident reviews, audits, and staff training.
### Data Collection and Incident Reviews
Each facility must conduct an annual review of all sexual abuse investigations and resulting incident reviews to assess and improve sexual abuse intervention, prevention, and response efforts (§115.87, §115.187). The Prevention of Sexual Assault (PSA) Coordinator shall work with relevant facility PSA Compliance Managers and DHS entities to share data on effective agency response methods to sexual abuse. Annually, the PSA Coordinator shall aggregate incident-based sexual abuse data, including the number of reported allegations and their outcomes, and prepare a report that includes a comparison with prior years' data and an assessment of the agency's progress (§115.87, §115.187). Each facility must also conduct a sexual abuse incident review at the conclusion of every investigation, preparing a written report within 30 days if the allegation was not unfounded, recommending changes to policy or practice as needed (§115.86, §115.186).
### Data Review for Corrective Action
The agency shall review the data collected and aggregated to identify problem areas, take corrective action on an ongoing basis, and prepare an annual report of findings and corrective actions for each facility and the agency as a whole (§115.88, §115.188). The report must include a comparison of current and prior years' data and an assessment of the agency's progress in preventing, detecting, and responding to sexual abuse.
### Audits
Audits of immigration detention facilities must be conducted by entities or individuals outside of the agency and DHS, with relevant audit experience (§115.201, §115.193). The auditor shall review all relevant agency policies, procedures, reports, internal and external audits, and accreditations for each facility type. The auditor must interview a representative sample of detainees and staff, review available videotapes and other electronic data, and retain all documentation used in making audit determinations (§115.202). Audit reports shall state whether facility policies and procedures comply with relevant standards, describe the methodology and basis for conclusions, and include recommendations for corrective action (§115.203). The agency and the facility must develop a corrective action plan to achieve compliance, and the auditor shall verify implementation of the plan (§115.204). A facility may appeal specific audit findings, and the findings of the re-audit shall be considered final (§115.205).
### Staff Training and Detainee Education
The agency shall train all employees who may have contact with immigration detainees and all facility staff to fulfill their responsibilities under this part, including training on zero-tolerance policies, definitions and examples of prohibited sexual behavior, recognition of signs of sexual abuse, and reporting procedures (§115.31). All current facility staff and agency employees must be trained within one year of May 6, 2014, and receive refresher training every two years. Each facility must ensure that the detainee orientation program includes instruction on zero-tolerance policies, prevention and intervention strategies, methods for reporting sexual abuse, self-protection, and the right to receive treatment and counseling (§115.33). The orientation must be provided in accessible formats for all detainees, including those with limited English proficiency, disabilities, and limited reading skills.
### Definitions and Coverage
This part covers ICE immigration detention facilities and DHS holding facilities (§115.10, §115.110). Key definitions include "family unit," "intersex," "qualified medical practitioner," and "sexual abuse" (§115.5, §115.6). The agency must have a written policy mandating zero tolerance toward all forms of sexual abuse and employ a PSA Coordinator with sufficient authority to develop, implement, and oversee compliance efforts (§115.11, §115.111).
### Additional Provisions
The regulations establish minimum requirements for agencies and facilities, and agency and facility policies may include additional requirements (§115.95, §115.110). The agency shall provide specialized training to medical and mental health practitioners on detecting and responding to sexual abuse, reporting allegations, and preserving evidence (§115.35). Facilities must assess detainees for risk of victimization and abusiveness, using the information to inform housing, recreation, and work assignments (§115.41, §115.42, §115.141). For transgender or intersex detainees, the facility shall consider the detainee's gender self-identification and consult a medical or mental health professional for placement decisions (§115.42).
