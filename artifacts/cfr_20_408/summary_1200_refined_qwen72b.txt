This part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) outlines the rules for Special Veterans Benefits (SVB) overpayments, including when and how the Social Security Administration (SSA) will waive recovery of overpayments and the conditions under which recovery would be against equity and good conscience.
### Eligibility and Overpayment Definitions
To qualify for SVB, you must meet specific service requirements, such as serving in the active military, naval, or air service of the United States during World War II (September 16, 1940 to July 24, 1947) or in the organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines while in the service of the U.S. (§408.218). Additionally, you must be eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and not have your SSI benefits terminated or subject to penalties (§408.218). An overpayment occurs when the amount paid to you exceeds the amount you are due for a given period, and an underpayment is the opposite (§408.902).
### Waiver of Overpayment Recovery
The SSA will waive recovery of an SVB overpayment if you are without fault and recovery would defeat the purpose of the title VIII program or be against equity and good conscience (§408.910, §408.912, §408.914). Being without fault means you did not engage in an affirmative act to conceal the overpayment, and recovery would defeat the purpose of the program if it would deprive you of income and resources needed for ordinary and necessary living expenses (§404.508(a)). Recovery would be against equity and good conscience if you changed your position for the worse or gave up a valuable right in reliance on the incorrect payment (§408.914).
### Procedures for Waiver Requests
If you request a waiver of recovery, the SSA will consider all pertinent circumstances to determine if you were without fault (§408.912). If the SSA determines you are without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience, they will waive the recovery of the overpayment (§408.910). For example, if you are found eligible for a waiver of recovery of $260, you and your estate are freed from the obligation to repay that amount (§408.910).
### Recovery of Overpayments
If you do not refund the overpayment and a waiver is not applicable, the SSA will adjust your SVB payments to recover the overpayment (§408.922). The amount withheld from your monthly SVB payment is limited to the lesser of the amount of your Federal SVB payment or 10 percent of the maximum SVB monthly payment (§408.923). You have the opportunity to request a higher or lower rate of withholding than the proposed amount (§408.923).
### Impact of Other Benefit Income
Other benefit income, such as annuities, pensions, or disability benefits, can affect your SVB eligibility. If your other benefit income is equal to or more than the maximum SVB payment, your SVB claim will be denied (§408.220). If you are qualified for SVB, your monthly SVB payments will be reduced by the amount of your other benefit income (§408.510). The monthly amount of your other benefit income is determined by converting non-monthly payments to an equivalent monthly amount (§408.224).
### Representative Payee and Misuse of Benefits
If a representative payee misuses your benefits, the rules for determining liability for repayment are found in §404.2041 of this chapter (§408.641). The SSA will follow the rules in §404.2050 to select a new representative payee for you, and the rules in §404.2055 to determine when to stop representative payment (§408.650, §408.655). Accumulated funds, including interest, will be handled according to §404.2060 when a representative payee changes or you begin receiving benefits directly (§408.660).
### Reconsideration and Good Cause
You can request reconsideration of an initial determination by filing a request within 60 days of receiving notice. If you miss the deadline, you may ask for an extension if you can show good cause, such as incorrect or incomplete information provided by the SSA (§408.1009, §408.1011). The SSA will consider the circumstances that prevented you from making the request on time to determine if good cause exists (§408.1011).
