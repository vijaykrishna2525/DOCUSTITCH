This part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) outlines the rules and procedures for determining and waiving overpayments of Special Veterans Benefits (SVB) and the conditions under which such overpayments may be recovered.
### Overpayment and Waiver of Recovery
An overpayment occurs when the amount paid exceeds the amount due for a given period (§408.902). The Social Security Administration (SSA) will withhold or adjust any underpayment due to reduce an overpayment unless recovery is waived under specific conditions (§408.910). Waiver of recovery is granted when the individual is without fault and recovery would either defeat the purpose of the title VIII program or be against equity and good conscience (§408.912, §408.914). Recovery would defeat the purpose of the program if it deprives the individual of necessary living expenses, as defined in §404.508(a). Recovery is against equity and good conscience if the individual changed their position for the worse or gave up a valuable right based on the incorrect payment.
### Determining Fault and Equity
To determine if an individual is without fault, the SSA considers all pertinent circumstances related to the overpayment (§408.912). Being without fault does not solely depend on the SSA's fault in making the overpayment. If the individual or a representative payee is without fault, and recovery would be against equity and good conscience, the SSA will waive recovery of the overpayment (§408.910(c)(3)). For example, if an individual is eligible for a waiver of recovery of $260, they and their estate are freed from the obligation to repay that amount.
### Recovery Process and Limits
If an overpayment is not refunded and waiver is not applicable, the SSA will adjust SVB payments to recover the overpayment (§408.922). The amount withheld each month is limited to the lesser of the individual's Federal SVB payment or 10 percent of the maximum SVB monthly payment (§408.923). The SSA will notify the individual of the proposed withholding rate and provide an opportunity to request a different rate.
### Other Benefit Income and SVB Eligibility
To qualify for SVB, an individual must meet specific service requirements, such as serving in the active military, naval, or air service of the United States during World War II (§408.218). Additionally, the individual must be eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and not have their SSI benefits terminated or subject to penalties (§408.218(c)). Other benefit income, such as annuities or pensions, can affect SVB eligibility if received within the 12 months before applying for SVB (§408.220). If the other benefit income equals or exceeds the maximum SVB payment, the claim will be denied. If eligible, SVB payments will be reduced by the amount of other benefit income (§408.510).
### Representative Payee and Misuse of Benefits
If a representative payee misuses SVB benefits, the SSA follows the rules in §404.2041 to determine liability for repayment (§408.641). The SSA will select a new representative payee or stop representative payment according to the rules in §404.2050 and §404.2055, respectively (§408.650, §408.655). Accumulated funds, including interest, are handled as described in §404.2060 when a representative payee changes or the individual begins receiving benefits directly (§408.660).
### Reconsideration and Good Cause
Individuals can request reconsideration of an initial determination by filing a request at the SSA. If the request is not made within 60 days, the individual may ask for an extension if they show good cause for missing the deadline (§408.1009). Good cause is determined based on the circumstances that prevented timely filing, including incorrect or incomplete information provided by the SSA (§408.1011).
This part ensures that overpayments are handled fairly and that individuals are not unduly burdened by recovery actions, while also maintaining the integrity of the SVB program.
