This part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) outlines the rules for Special Veterans Benefits (SVB) and the procedures for handling overpayments and underpayments.
### Eligibility and Qualification
To qualify for SVB, you must be a World War II veteran who served in the active military, naval, or air service of the United States during the period from September 16, 1940, to July 24, 1947, or in the organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines while in the service of the U.S. (§408.216). Additionally, you must be eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and not have had your SSI eligibility terminated or be subject to a penalty (§408.218). Other benefit income, such as annuities or pensions, can affect your SVB eligibility if received within the 12 months before applying for SVB. If your other benefit income equals or exceeds the maximum SVB payment, your claim will be denied (§408.220).
### Overpayments and Underpayments
An overpayment occurs when you receive more benefits than you are entitled to, and an underpayment occurs when you receive less (§408.901, §408.902). If an overpayment is detected, we will withhold or adjust any underpayment due to you to reduce the overpayment, unless recovery is waived (§408.905). The amount of an overpayment or underpayment is the difference between the amount paid and the amount due for a given period (§408.903).
### Waiver of Overpayment Recovery
We may waive recovery of an overpayment if you are without fault and recovery would defeat the purpose of the title VIII program or be against equity and good conscience (§408.910, §408.912, §408.913, §408.914). Being without fault means you did not act with intent to conceal or mislead, and recovery would defeat the purpose of the program if it would deprive you of income and resources needed for ordinary and necessary living expenses (§404.508(a)). Recovery is against equity and good conscience if you changed your position for the worse or gave up a valuable right based on our notice or incorrect payment (§408.914).
### Recovery Procedures
If you do not refund the overpayment and waiver is not applicable, we will adjust your SVB payments to recover the overpayment. The amount withheld each month is limited to the lesser of the amount of your SVB payment or 10 percent of the maximum SVB monthly payment (§408.923). We will notify you of the proposed withholding rate and give you the opportunity to request a different rate (§408.922). Cross-program recovery may also be used to collect overpayments from benefits payable under title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act (§408.931).
### Representative Payees and Misuse
If a representative payee misuses your benefits, the rules in §404.2041 of this chapter determine who is liable for repayment (§408.641). We will follow the rules in §404.2050 and §404.2055 to select a new representative payee or stop representative payment, and §404.2060 describes what happens to accumulated funds when a representative payee changes (§408.655, §408.660).
### Appeals and Reconsideration
You can request reconsideration of an initial determination within 60 days of receiving notice, and the deadline may be extended if you show good cause (§408.1009, §408.1011). Good cause may include serious illness, misleading information from us, or physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (§408.1011). If we notify you of a suspension, reduction, or termination of your SVB payments, you can appeal within 60 days, with possible extensions for good cause (§408.1015). We will notify you of the reconsidered determination in writing, stating the reasons and your right to a hearing (§408.1022).
### Filing and Application Procedures
Your application for SVB must be on the prescribed form (SSA-2000-F6) and filed with the Social Security Administration (SSA) (§408.310). If you file a written statement indicating your intent to claim SVB, we will use the filing date of the statement, provided it meets certain requirements (§408.340). You must sign your own application if you are mentally competent and physically able to do so (§408.315). We will send you a notice of intended action if we plan to suspend, reduce, or terminate your SVB payments, except in cases of confirmed death (§408.820).
### Reporting Requirements
You must report any events listed in §408.708 as soon as they occur, such as changes in your income or living situation (§408.714).
### Tax Refund Offset
We may refer an SVB overpayment to the Department of the Treasury for tax refund offset, following the procedures in §§408.940 through 408.946 (§408.940).
This part ensures that SVB recipients are treated fairly and that overpayments are handled in a manner that does not unduly burden those who are without fault.
