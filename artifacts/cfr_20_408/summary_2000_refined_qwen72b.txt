This part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) outlines the rules and procedures for determining and recovering overpayments of Special Veterans Benefits (SVB) and the conditions under which such overpayments may be waived.
### Eligibility and Definitions
To qualify for SVB, you must meet specific service requirements, including active military, naval, or air service in the United States during World War II (September 16, 1940, to July 24, 1947) or service in the organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines while in the service of the U.S. (§408.218). Additionally, you must be eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and not have your SSI benefits terminated or subject to penalties (§408.218). Other benefit income, such as annuities, pensions, or disability benefits, can affect your SVB eligibility if received within the 12 months before applying for SVB. If your other benefit income equals or exceeds the maximum SVB payment, your claim will be denied (§408.220).
### Overpayment and Underpayment
An overpayment occurs when you receive more SVB than you are entitled to, while an underpayment occurs when you receive less. The amount of an overpayment or underpayment is the difference between the amount paid and the amount due for a given period (§408.902). If we detect a potential overpayment but have not made a determination, we will not delay making an underpayment determination and payment unless we can finalize the overpayment determination within the following month (§408.902).
### Waiver of Overpayment Recovery
We may waive recovery of an overpayment if you are without fault and recovery would defeat the purpose of the title VIII program or be against equity and good conscience (§408.912, §408.914). Being without fault means you did not act with intent to conceal or mislead, and recovery would defeat the program's purpose if it deprives you of necessary living expenses (§404.508(a)). Recovery is against equity and good conscience if you changed your position for the worse or gave up a valuable right based on our notice or incorrect payment (§408.914). If we waive recovery, you and your estate are freed from the obligation to repay the overpayment (§408.910).
### Recovery Procedures
If you do not refund the overpayment and waiver is not applicable, we will adjust your SVB payments to recover the overpayment. This is typically done by withholding a specified amount each month, limited to the lesser of the amount of your SVB payment or 10% of the maximum SVB monthly payment (§408.923). You can request a higher or lower withholding rate, and we will notify you of the proposed rate and provide an opportunity to request a different rate (§408.922).
### Representative Payee and Misuse
If a representative payee misuses your benefits, the rules for determining liability are found in §404.2041. We will follow the rules in §404.2050 to select a new representative payee and in §404.2055 to stop representative payment. Accumulated funds, including interest, will be handled according to §404.2060 when a representative payee changes or you begin receiving benefits directly (§408.650, §408.655, §408.660).
### Appeals and Reconsideration
You can request reconsideration of an initial determination by filing a request within 60 days of receiving notice. If you miss the deadline, you can ask for an extension if you show good cause, such as circumstances that prevented you from making the request on time or receiving incorrect information from us (§408.1009, §408.1011).
### Summary
This part of the CFR provides detailed guidelines for SVB eligibility, overpayment and underpayment definitions, conditions for waiving overpayment recovery, recovery procedures, representative payee responsibilities, and the appeals process. The primary focus is on ensuring that overpayment recovery does not unduly burden eligible veterans and that the program's purpose is upheld.
