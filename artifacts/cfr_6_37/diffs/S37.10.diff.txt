-(a) Application criteria. A State requesting a certificate of waiver must establish in its application that the mDLs for which the State seeks a waiver are issued with controls sufficient to resist compromise and fraud attempts, provide privacy protections sufficient to safeguard an mDL holder's identity data, and provide interoperability for secure acceptance by Federal agencies under the terms of a certificate of waiver. To demonstrate compliance with such requirements, a State must provide information, documents, and/or data sufficient to explain the means, which includes processes, methodologies, or policies, that the State has implemented to comply with requirements in this paragraph (a). (1) Provisioning. For both remote and in-person provisioning, a State must explain the means it uses to address or perform the following— (i) Data encryption. Securely encrypt mDL data and an mDL holder's Personally Identifiable Information when such data is transferred during provisioning, and when stored on the State's system(s) and on mDL holders' mobile devices. (ii) Escalated review. Review repeated failed attempts at provisioning, resolve such failures, and establish criteria to determine when the State will deny provisioning an mDL to a particular mDL applicant. (iii) Authentication. Confirm that an mDL applicant has control over the mobile device to which an mDL is being provisioned at the time of provisioning. (iv) Device identification keys. Confirm that the mDL applicant possesses the mDL device private key bound to the mDL during provisioning. (v) User identity verification. Prevent an individual from falsely matching with the licensing agency's records, including portrait images, of other individuals. (vi) Applicant presentation. Prevent physical and digital presentation attacks by detecting the liveness of an individual and any alterations to the individual's appearance during remote and in-person provisioning. (vii) DHS_compliance data element. Set the value of data element “DHS_compliance”, as required by paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, to correspond to the REAL ID compliance status of the underlying physical driver's license or identification card that a State has issued to an mDL holder as follows— (A) “F” if the underlying card is REAL ID-compliant, or as otherwise required by AAMVA Mobile Driver's License (mDL) Implementation Guidelines, Section 3.2 (incorporated by reference; see § 37.4); or (B) “N” if the underlying card is not REAL ID-compliant. (viii) Data record.
