This part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) outlines the requirements for states to comply with the REAL ID Act, focusing on security measures, background checks, and certification processes for issuing REAL ID driver's licenses and identification cards.
### Security Plan and Physical Security
States must develop and submit a security plan as part of their REAL ID certification (§37.41). The plan must address physical security for facilities where driver's licenses and identification cards are produced, as well as the security of document materials and papers used in their production. States must also describe the security of DMV facilities in their security plan. Physical security measures are essential to prevent unauthorized access and tampering with the production process.
### Background Checks for Covered Employees
States are required to conduct background checks on covered employees, defined as DMV employees or contractors involved in the manufacture or production of REAL ID driver's licenses and identification cards, or those who can affect the identity information on these documents (§37.45). Background checks are not required for employees who have been continuously employed by the DMV since May 11, 2006, or for those who have undergone substantially similar background checks since that date. States may establish procedures to waive certain background check requirements under specific circumstances.
### Physical Security Features and Unique Identification
States must ensure that each REAL ID driver's license or identification card has unique physical security features and a unique number that is not the individual's Social Security Number (§37.15). The card must also bear a DHS-approved security marking indicating its level of compliance with the REAL ID Act (§37.51). States must make reasonable efforts to prevent individuals from obtaining multiple driver's licenses or identification cards under different identities (§37.13).
### Machine-Readable Technology
The machine-readable portion of the REAL ID driver's license or identification card must comply with the ISO/IEC 15438:2006(E) standard (§37.19). This standard ensures that the card can be reliably read by federal agencies and other authorized entities.
### State Certification and Compliance
States must file the required documentation for REAL ID certification at least 90 days before the effective date of full compliance (§37.55). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will review the documentation, conduct audits as necessary, and make a preliminary determination on compliance within 45 days. States must cooperate with DHS's review at any time. If a state fails to meet the requirements, DHS will notify the state and may determine non-compliance (§37.59). States must recertify compliance every three years on a rolling basis as determined by DHS.
### Temporary or Limited-Term Driver's Licenses and Identification Cards
States may issue temporary or limited-term REAL ID driver's licenses and identification cards to individuals with temporary lawful status in the United States (§37.21). Before issuing such cards, states must require valid documentary evidence of lawful status, verifiable through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program or other DHS-approved means.
### Definitions and Incorporation by Reference
The part includes definitions for key terms such as "covered employees," "DMV," and "REAL ID Driver's License or Identification Card" (§37.3). Certain material is incorporated by reference into this part, and all approved material is available for inspection at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) (§37.4).
### Compliance Extensions and Waivers
States may request an extension of the compliance deadline, which DHS will review and may grant until December 31, 2009, or May 10, 2011, based on the state's demonstration of material compliance (§37.63). States may also apply for a temporary waiver for mobile driver's licenses (mDLs) by filing a complete application with TSA, which will issue a certificate of waiver if the mDLs meet specified security and privacy standards (§37.10).
### Final Compliance Determination
DHS will notify states of its final determination of compliance within 45 days of receiving a state's reply to a preliminary determination (§37.61). States that fail to meet the requirements or do not submit timely certification may be deemed non-compliant, and their driver's licenses and identification cards will not be acceptable for official purposes.
